  <center>We take great pride in our dirt. Each cubic foot is placed through rigourous tests to remove pests and parasites. Each block is then placed into an oven to really kill the pests. Then Ryan adds his 700 secret herbs and spices to really spruce things up. Dirt is compacted into blocks for easy transport then airdropped at your house! Our dirt is the cheapest around. Just $600 for 9 individual cubic cubes. </center>
