  <center>We take great pride in our dirt. Each cubic foot is placed through rigourous tests to remove pests and paracites. Each block is then placed into an oven to really kill the pests. Dirt is compacted into blocks for easy transport then delivered by drones
    to your home. Our dirt is the cheapest around. Just $600 for 9 individual cubic cubes. Our dirt is not treated with toxic gases. Just 100 different non-radioactive elements.</center>
